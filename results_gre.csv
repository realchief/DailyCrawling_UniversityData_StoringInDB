bgsu.edu,www.bgsu.edu,http://www.bgsu.edu/arts-and-sciences/about-the-college/deans-message.html,False,Dean's Message,"Welcome to the Web page of the College of Arts & Sciences. We've designed this site as a way to introduce you to the College Office staff, as well as the wealth of services they provide to students, including academic advising.
Although we're BGSU's largest college, we pride ourselves on the personal attention we afford students. The College advising staff is available to help undecided students determine the major that's right for them, explore career options, schedule classes, and plan ahead so they can graduate on time. Faculty advisors in each of our departments are also available to advise their majors about internships, co-ops, courses, graduate school, and careers as well as talk to them about their long-range aspirations and immediate concerns.
Our Web page is also a gateway to the many academic programs the College offers at both the undergraduate and graduate levels, ranging from digital arts and neuroscience to Media Production and Studies and popular culture, from biology and Japanese to computer science and women's studies - and beyond. In fact, the College offers almost 100 majors, over 100 minors, 22 masters programs, and 11 doctoral programs designed to introduce you to a fascinating world of ideas.  These programs will spark your imagination and expand your horizons, while at the same time helping you prepare for graduate study and acquire the skills necessary for success in hundreds of satisfying careers.
As a College of Arts & Sciences student, you'll have the opportunity to take classes from over 400 faculty members, many of whom are nationally and internationally recognized in their fields. Indeed, 16 of BGSU's 26 Master Teachers reside in the College. Arts & Sciences faculty bring the latest knowledge into their classes, ensuring students receive the benefit of today's research discoveries.
Arts & Sciences faculty take a special interest in helping students achieve at the highest levels. Each year, hundreds of Arts & Sciences students work individually with faculty members on independent study and research projects. These experiences enable students to develop a deep understanding of a discipline, acquire problem-solving skills, and prepare for graduate and professional school.
The College is additionally proud to be the home of the Xi of Ohio chapter of Phi Beta Kappa, thereby offering outstanding juniors and seniors membership in the nation's oldest and most selective honorary society - a distinction highly regarded in professional and academic worlds. Arts & Sciences students also have opportunities for membership in a wide variety of honorary societies and clubs sponsored by the College's many departments and programs. Among these are the Mock Trial Team, and the Forensics, Speech and Debate Team.
Outstanding programs in the natural sciences, mathematics, statistics, and computer science prepare students for life and careers in today's high-tech world, while innovative majors and minors in the social sciences and humanities provide a firm foundation for understanding human behavior, social and political institutions, and our own and other cultures. Indeed, our strong international studies and language programs - including Academic Year Abroad and exchange programs in Africa, Asia, Europe, and Latin America - open the world to you. Moreover, our interdisciplinary programs offer students rich opportunities to examine science, society, and culture from a variety of perspectives.
The College also contributes to BGSU's dynamic arts scene. A nationally recognized School of Art, an outstanding Theater and Film Department, a growing Film Studies program, and highly regarded Creative Writing program offer students rich opportunities to develop their creative abilities and sponsor a wealth of plays, readings, shows, screenings, and lectures that enrich the entire campus community.
These vibrant programs contribute powerfully to student success. In recent years Arts & Sciences students have received a number of accolades and honors, receiving Fulbright and Goldwater awards, and contributing to the betterment of society through research and service work.
Arts & Sciences is especially proud of and grateful to our dedicated alumni and friends, who serve in a variety of capacities to advance the College and our students. Whether serving on our Arts & Sciences Advocates Board, contributing to a student scholarship or program, or volunteering for events and programs designed to assist students, such as the Career Extravaganza, the College is able to achieve more for our students with the help of our loyal alumni and friends.
Please use this site to explore the wide variety of programs we offer. If you have further questions, I invite you to direct them to a department or to us in the College of Arts & Sciences.

Bienvenue! Welcome!
Because La Maison represents one of the smaller living-learning communities on campus, each resident is acknowledged as an essential participant, and the emphasis on community is very important.
La Maison Française is a residential learning community where students interested in French can live and be surrounded by the language and cultures of the Francophone world. Located in Kohl Hall, La Maison Française is designed to house up to 12 undergraduate male and female students who have had at least 2 years of high school French or FREN 1020 at BGSU. The Faculty Director has an on-site office and several French classes are offered in Kohl Hall classrooms. 
Regular events include a weekly conversation hour, monthly movie nights and dinners, for which residents earn 2 credit hours of FREN 2200. La Maison Française is an ideal gathering place for students and faculty from the BGSU community who are interested in French and Francophone cultures.
Residents of La Maison Française learning community are eligible for two scholarships. The French House Resident Scholarship awards $1,000 to all eligible residents. The Wurzburger Memorial Fund Scholarship provides support for study abroad in France. Please contact the Faculty Director for further details.

Students learn together in and beyond the space of the seminar room, developing research, teaching and civic identities through a range of coursework in rhetorical, cultural, empirical and digital approaches to writing.
Rhetoric and Writing Students Create Successful Annual Graduate Conference
The fourth annual 21st Century Englishes Conference took place on the campus of BGSU on Saturday, October 15, 2016. The conference drew students from across the country, from California to North Carolina, for an engaging day of graduate scholarship. This year's theme was interdisciplinarity and transdisciplinarity, and presentations covered the spectrum from creative non-fiction, to digital humanities, to English language learners, visual analysis, creative discourse analysis, historical analysis, and more. 
BGSU's own Dr. Andrea Riley-Mukavetz provided the keynote address. Her presentation, titled ""Listening to Our Relations: Mapping Michigan Indian History,"" explored the importance of place and space, identity, embodied rhetorics, and storytelling. Dr. Lee Nickoson and Dr. Sue Carter Wood provided the opening and closing remarks, respectively, bookending an amazing conference experience. Special thanks are in order to the Rhetoric Society of the Black Swamp, the BGSU student chapter of the Rhetoric Society of America, for sponsoring and planning the conference.

bgsu.edu,www.bgsu.edu,http://www.bgsu.edu/arts-and-sciences/psychology/graduate-program.html,False,Graduate Programs,"The goal of the Department of Psychology is to develop a scientific community for significant psychological research. With a genuine sense of community, traditional but essentially false distinctions – such as that between scholar and practitioner – can be blurred. The concept of community implies an atmosphere in which people of differing specialized interests and of differing academic levels can provide mutual support rather than competition, communication rather than isolation, stimulation rather than disinterest.  Graduate Brochure (pdf)
AREAS OF CONCENTRATION
There are four doctoral program areas, all of which lead to a Ph.D. in Psychology: Clinical , Developmental , Industrial-Organizational (I-O) , and the Neural and Cognitive Sciences (NCS). There is also an Interdisciplinary degree program with the Department of Computer Science and the NCS doctoral program whereby a student can receive an M.S. in Computer Science, an M.A. in Psychology, and a Ph.D. in Psychology.
While graduate students normally meet the requirements for the master's degree en route to the Ph.D., we do not generally admit students who seek only the master's degree.
MISSION STATEMENT

The primary goal of the Ph.D. program is the development of scientists capable of advancing psychological knowledge. The program is characterized by both an emphasis on extensive academic training in general psychology and an early and continuing commitment to research. Although each graduate student will seek an area in which to develop his or her own expertise, students will be expected to be knowledgeable about many areas and will be encouraged to pursue interests that cross conventional specialty lines.

The program is research oriented; students are encouraged to become involved in research early in the first year of graduate training. Each student normally works in close association with a sponsor or chairperson whose special competence matches the student's interests but students are free to pursue research interests with any faculty member and in any area(s) they choose. Both basic and applied research are well represented within the department. The quality of the Department of Psychology was recently recognized by substantial Academic Challenge grants by the Ohio Board of Regents to enhance the doctoral programs in the clinical and industrial-organizational psychology areas.

The student-faculty ratio is low, permitting extensive supervision and individual attention to the student's growth and development. One of the major strengths of our program is the extent to which students and faculty share interests with those in other areas. Students frequently work closely with faculty from as many as three areas and/or interests during their tenure here.
ADMISSION REQUIRMENTS


Undergraduate Psychology courses: Introduction to Psychology, statistics and experimental.
GRE required: Verbal and Quantitative. Advanced test in Psychology is optional. Although we have no minimum score requirements, median GRE scores of current students are in the 70th-80th percentile range. Median GPA's are 3.70.
Importance of nonobjective criteria: previous research activity, high; work experience, high; extracurricular activity, medium; clinically related public service, low; letters of recommendation, high.

TEACHING OPPORTUNITIES

The following teaching opportunities are available: teaching assistant to professor and laboratory instructor for one or more courses. Courses are offered in the teaching of psychology. Opportunities for selected students to teach independent sections of lower division undergraduate courses are also available.
MINORITY CONSIDERATIONS

The department provides for minority students in the following ways: affirmative action/recruitment program; special tutorial programs available; and deferral of admission fee until admitted into program.
FINANCIAL AID

For students interested in a MA degree, additional information can be found here.
The doctoral program in the Department of Theatre and Film at Bowling Green State University is especially designed for those students planning careers as faculty members in higher education with a degree emphasis in the theories (both historical and contemporary), histories, and cultural applications of theatre and performance (both aesthetic and cultural) in various contexts. It is this aspect of the program that prepares students to contribute meaningfully to theatre and performance scholarship and to be effective teachers within those disciplines.
Practically, the course of study aims to prepare graduates to conduct original research, to teach, and to participate in theatre production in educational settings in a range of capacities. Accordingly, students are evaluated in three areas: scholarship, teaching ability, and artistry.  While the mission of the department is to prepare graduates who approach the theory and practice of theatre and performance in an integrated manner, it should be understood that the primary emphasis of any doctoral program in the arts focuses on historical, theoretical, and pedagogical approaches to the subject matter rather than solely or even predominantly on artistic practice.
For students interested in a Ph.D. degree, additional information can be found here.
The performance studies certificate is open to all graduate students enrolled at Bowling Green State University. Through this certificate program the student will explore the histories, theories, and practices of Performance Studies. The focus is on the relationship between text and practice; performance as a reflection of society, a witnessing to an experience, or a challenge to social structures or ways of knowing; emerging ideas of audience reception theory; interdisciplinary connections with cultural studies, communication studies; and U.S./global performance practices. The certificate may be used as a research methodology or area of specialization within a degree program or other course of study, as a gateway into an advanced degree program in Performance Studies/related field, or as a foundation for work in community-based performance or theatre of social action/change.
Curriculum: 
Core Sequence (7 credits):
THFM 6630 Introduction to Performance Studies (3)
THFM 6680 Performance Studies (3)
THFM 6660 Directed Research in Portfolio Development to serve as a capstone experience. (1)

Supplementary Elective Courses (9 credits):

GENERAL DESCRIPTION
The Master of Fine Arts in art program is designed to produce professionally competent artists who are aware of the great traditions in art and related cultural fields. The intent of the program is to produce graduates who are more than mere technicians in art. Students receive training in the fundamentals and achieve a level of competence that will enable them to contribute to the field of art. The MFA program prepares students to become either professional artists or teachers of art after receiving the degree.

MFA students may choose from the following majors:

Digital Arts (includes Computer Animation, Digital Imaging and Interactive Media)
Three-Dimensional Studies (includes Ceramics, Glass, Jewelry/Metals and Sculpture)
Two-Dimensional Studies (includes Drawing, Painting, Photography* and Printmaking)

   *Applications in Photography are not being accepted indefinitely.

DEGREE REQUIREMENTS
Students majoring in a studio area work with the Graduate Coordinator to choose the student's major professor. The Major Professor will work with the Graduate Coordinator to oversee the student's matriculation process and will serve as the chair of the student's Graduate Review Committee. The Graduate Review Committee is composed of three graduate faculty members, including the Major Professor.

Students entering the MFA degree program have probationary status during the first 15 semester hours of work. In the semester immediately following the completion of this 15-hour requirement (summer excepted), the student must pass the initial review for permission to continue in the program.

Candidates for the MFA degree must complete a minimum of 60 semester credit hours at the graduate level (only grades of ""C"" or better will count as hours toward graduation).

21 semester hours within studio specialization
12 semester hours of studio elective courses (may come from the specialization)
9 semester hours of studio critique
6 semester hours of art history class (one 500 level and one 600 level)
3 semester hours of academic elective (must be graduate level)
3 semester hours of general elective (must be graduate level, can be studio art or academic elective)
3 semester hours of pedagogy
3 semester hours of exhibition research

Awarding of the degree is contingent upon recommendation for graduation by the Graduate Review Committee after a final review of work submitted by each candidate.

Total hour requirements may be reduced for students who can apply credit from previous graduate work. Students are required to complete a minimum of two full-time semesters in residence.

The MFA exhibition, required of each student, is the culmination of the candidate's work in his/her studio discipline. The exhibition is a major show including an in-lieu-of-thesis statement and documentation of the work, which must be accompanied by an exhibition brochure. MFA exhibitions are usually held spring semester in the Dorothy Uber Bryan Gallery in the Fine Arts Center, though exceptions can be made. The MFA exhibition must be approved by the Graduate Review Committee.
ADMISSION
Prospective graduate students need to apply to both the Graduate College and the School of Art. MFA candidates are required to submit a portfolio and application materials.
