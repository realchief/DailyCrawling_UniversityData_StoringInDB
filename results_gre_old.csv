Since the qualities that make a superior physics teacher may differ from those that mark a superior ceramics instructor, nomination letters clearly specify what makes each nominee outstanding in their field, and supporting materials show the ways in which the nominee embodies these qualities. All nominations are reviewed by a College-level committee appointed by the Dean.
The College of Arts and Sciences Diversity Award recognizes faculty leadership of student-led projects and initiatives related to diversity.  Educational influence on BGSU students is the main criterion that the A&S Diversity Committee considers in determining the recipient of the A&S Diversity Award. The selected faculty member have led a student project or initiative that increased awareness of at least one diversity related issue. Projects considered for recognition may have been undertaken within the BGSU campus community or extended to off campus locations in order to foster change in local, state, national, and international communities.
